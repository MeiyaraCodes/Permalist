# Permalist
This is a practice project in the Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu on Udemy. It is built with a backend powered by Node.js and Express, and database of PostgreSQL using pgAdmin. I have utilized Render to power both Node and SQL so that this project can go live.

To use this code, you may click the CODE button in the upper right side then Download ZIP. Once unzipped, open Visual Studio and CD to the file. NPM INSTALL and NPM AUDIT FIX to install and fix the necessary dependencies. You may immediately use NODE INDEX.JS / NODEMON INDEX.JS to view the website on the local computer.

For the PostgreSQL Database, you may use pgAdmin (application) to create tables as intended. Use the queries.sql to create the tables. You should also make a .env file to store database URL, host, user, password, and port to connect Database and Node.
